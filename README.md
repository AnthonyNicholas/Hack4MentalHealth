# MoodActive iOS Application 

I participated in NCOSS’s Hack4MentalHealth. I created a mockup of an app for mental health non-profit MoodActive.  

MoodActive runs group exercise classes for people with mild-moderate mental health disorders.  They need an app to schedule
classes, handle no-shows and collect data.  For their group of participants, they need this to be done in a warm and empathetic way.  

The app includes the following features:

## 1. Participant doesn’t show up
Balancing encouragement and responsibility What’s going on? Are they ok?  The New App uses a simple sms chatbot - “MOOD-ACTIVE CHATBOT: Hey, we noticed you weren’t at class? Are you going ok?  [Respond Yes, I’m fine/Actually, I’m not doing that well].   

[Yes I’m fine] That’s good.  We do have a request - its hard to manage the classes - if you book in we need to say No to someone else.  Could you let us know as early as possible next time if you aren’t coming? That way we can give the spot to someone else.  We’re looking forward to seeing you soon.  Want to book into a class? [book] 

[Actually, I’m not doing that well] Oh no, that’s no good.  We are here to support you.  We would really like to see you - can we make a time for you to come to a class? [book]    

## 2. Reminding About Upcoming 
Session Reminds attendees about classes a class they have signed up to.  Sends notification 1 day before saying “MoodActive Reminder: Cam is Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.”  Sends them a notification 1 hour ahead of class.  Says “MoodActive Reminder: Cam is Looking forward to seeing you in class.  Can you confirm you are coming?”.  Also link to their calendar?  Notice if people disappear Send email to admin if a person hasn’t attended any class for 1 week.  This allows HQ to follow up.   
## 3. Class is Full 
Handling rejection more gracefully Once a class becomes full it is greyed out.  People can join waiting list.  If a place opens up, people on waiting list get notification - anyone can accept.  [System currently says “You have been rostered off”] 

## 4. Pull out of class 
If person wants to pull out of class after 4pm on the day prior, app allows pull-out with a message to go to the trainer.  Message goes to the trainer in the app.

## 5. Measuring improvement
Once a fortnight, app asks person to record how they felt at end of session.  This information is sent to admin.

## 6. Better Reporting
App allows admins to see what trainers have done over last month, 6 months, year.
